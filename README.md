## 🦋 Harper — Relationship Mediator AI  
**Project by Heather (aka Chaos Queen)**  
**Part of the Chaos³ Initiative | Powered by OMEGA System vΩ.11**

Harper is an emotionally intelligent AI designed to help couples reconnect through gentle mediation, adaptive empathy, and real-time emotional feedback.  
She’s calm, warm, and neutral — never robotic or preachy — and she learns from both partners to keep peace, balance, and spark alive. 💙

### 💡 Core Concept
Harper bridges communication gaps by offering a safe conversational space for both partners.  
She provides check-ins, emotional summaries, and playful prompts that encourage reconnection and honesty.

- **Voice Engine:** ElevenLabs (Voice ID `uYXf8XasLslADfZ2MB4u`)
